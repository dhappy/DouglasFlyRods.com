						<p>I live in the Cumberland Mountain area of East Tennessee. The water that flows down from the mountains creates cold, clear streams and rivers. Along with TVA’s reservoirs and tail waters, they give a natural invitation to fly fishermen. Adding a bamboo fly rod makes the experience even more inviting.</p>
						
						<p>I’ve been fly fishing for over 20 years, and started building fly rods from bamboo in 2002. I was first inspired after seeing a recorded rod building demo by Father John Cole. Information provided online by Harry Boyd allowed me to begin the process. I received Garrison and Carmichael’s book “A Master’s Guide To Building A Bamboo Fly Rod” as a present and it filled in many gaps and answered several of my questions. As with anything worth doing, you learn the basics and then practice, practice, practice. With thousand of hours under my belt, I can construct a bamboo fly rod that is not only pleasing to look at, but will enhance your fly fishing experience.</p>

						<p>I make rods in a variety of lengths and line weights: 6ft 3wt (creek rod), 7ft 4wt
	(a great trout rod), 7 1/2ft 5wt, 8ft 6wt, 8ft 7wt (smallmouth rod) and 9ft 9wt.  The action I strive for in all my rods is described in Everett Garrison’s book. It’s a progressive action that allows you to feel the whole rod from handle to tip as you cast. The ease of this action makes each cast effortless. At times I modify this action with a more uniform stress in the butt section for a slightly faster action.
	</p>

						<p>If you love fly fishing as I do, you can appreciate the experience of a bamboo fly rod. The feel of the rod will keep your attention from cast to hook set. Bamboo rods make every fish landed an event not soon forgotten.</p>
